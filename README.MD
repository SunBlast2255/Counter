# Counter Web App

A minimalist counter application with a dark-themed interface, built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The counts are stored in local storage. Therefore, even after a page refresh, all data will be saved.

# Interface

- Counter Display: Shows the current count value in real-time.

- Increment Button (+): Adds one to the current count.

- Decrement Button (-): Subtracts one from the current count.

- Reset Button: Resets the counter back to zero.

# Usage

Simply click the increment, decrement, or reset buttons to adjust the counter. The app will display the current count and remember the last count value, even after page reloads.
